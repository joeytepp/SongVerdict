# SongVerdict

A real-time, crowd-sourced music review website created with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) and using the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/). Uses data from users to compile ranked lists of songs.

# Usage

After cloning the repo, run the following scripts, run

`npm install`

Then, create a .env file in the root of your project folder following the `.envexample` file (you will need to obtain credentials from [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/). Finally, run

`npm start & node server`
